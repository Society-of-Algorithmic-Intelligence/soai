    talkTitle: "Towards Practical Quantum Advantage",
    abstract:
      "Quantum advantage is no longer only a theoretical possibility. Recent demonstrations have shown that quantum computers can outperform leading classical approaches on selected scientific problems, marking a milestone the field has pursued for years. But demonstrating quantum advantage is not the same as making it useful. The next challenge is to identify where quantum computation can deliver meaningful improvements over the best end-to-end classical workflows, from understanding complex molecules and materials to tackling real-world optimization and simulation problems in finance, science, and industry. Meeting this challenge will require further progress across the full quantum computing stack, including hardware, software, algorithms, and applications. We must understand where today's strongest computational methods truly struggle and reconsider whether existing models and formulations capture the problems we actually want to solve. In this talk, I will discuss what it may take to turn quantum advantage into practical quantum advantage, where the most credible opportunities may lie, and how quantum computing, AI, and classical computing can complement one another.",

    abstract:
      "Artificial intelligence is evolving beyond language understanding towards modelling and interacting with the real world. This talk explores the progression from foundation models and large language models to world models that can learn, predict, and simulate the dynamics of physical and digital environments. We examine how advances in multimodal AI, robotics, and scientific computing are enabling machines to move from predicting the next word to predicting the next state of the world. Finally, we discuss the emerging role of quantum computing, and how AI is proving to be a key technology for scaling quantum processors into useful quantum-GPU supercomputing devices.",

    abstract:
      "We are conducting the JHPC Quantum project to design and build a quantum–supercomputer hybrid computing platform that integrates multiple on-premises quantum computers—namely, an IBM superconducting quantum computer and a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer—with several supercomputers, including Fugaku and GPU-based supercomputer systems. The platform is now operational and is being made available to researchers through our test user program. Using this platform, we are exploring a wide range of applications and use cases for quantum–HPC hybrid computing, with the goal of demonstrating utility-scale quantum computing through the effective integration of quantum and high-performance computing resources. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the JHPC Quantum project and its current status, highlight applications and recent activities on the platform, and discuss our perspective on the future of quantum–HPC hybrid computing.",

    talkTitle: "Signature-based time series statistical analysis",
    abstract:
      "Signature transform has recently gained significant attention in the theory of stochastic analysis. In this talk, I will discuss how the signature transform can be exploited to address several long standing challenges in analyzing time series data, which are typically non-stationary, nonlinear and often fragmented, and for which modern deep learning models are inappropriate due to limited interpretability and in principle require large volumes of training data. In particular, we propose a simple signature-based adaptive Lasso approach that has been successfully developed and implemented in industry. This method addresses many of the challenges mentioned above while demonstrating strong potential for a wide range of applications. The talk will begin with a brief introduction to the signature transform, which has its origins in topology and has been extensively developed within the rough path theory. We will then review the key properties of the signature transform that are most relevant to our statistical methodology. The talk is intended to be self-contained.",
