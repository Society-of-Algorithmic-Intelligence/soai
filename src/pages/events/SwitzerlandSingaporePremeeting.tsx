            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
              Innovation does not happen linearly — it follows S-curves. To sustain industrial value creation, the
              next wave of technology must already be gaining momentum before the current one reaches maturity. This
              creates a fundamental challenge: investments in emerging technologies are needed long before their value
              and success are fully proven — the classic Innovator's Dilemma.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
              In deep-tech innovation management, universities and governments play a critical role in shaping this
              transition. Universities act at the forefront of innovation, providing environments where new
              technologies can be explored and matured. At the same time, governments can strategically enable and
              accelerate these developments.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
              In this session, we dive into Data Science, AI, and Quantum Computing — technologies with different
              levels of maturity and disruptive potential for global industries and societies. We will explore the
              deep-tech ecosystem in Singapore and compare it with Switzerland. What can we learn from different
              approaches to fostering innovation? How can we better bridge the gap between research and industrial
              impact?
