    summary:
      "NVIDIA introduced mPDLP, a new multi-GPU Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient solver for linear programming in NVIDIA cuOpt that distributes large-scale LP problems across NVLink-connected GPUs, extending decision optimization to 100 million variables and beyond. Benchmarks across more than 100 LP instances show up to 11.4× faster iterations than single-GPU PDLP and up to 6× lower peak memory usage per GPU, while partners Kinaxis and PSR report 3.3× and 5×+ speedups on 135-million- and 185-million-variable supply-chain and energy-planning models.",

    summary:
      "SoAI highlights a major milestone for QuBowl, the QUBO solver developed by President-Elect Prof. Dr. Thorsten Koch with Dr. Yuji Shinano and Dr. Daniel Rehfeldt. The latest Mittelmann benchmark results place QuBowl at the state of the art: it is about 2.59× faster than the second‑best solver, solves 16 of 23 instances (three more than the nearest competitor), and this release is roughly 43% faster than the previous version.",
